<h2>Creation and simulation of an initial model with Mini Warteschlangensimulator</h2>

<div class="titledimage">
  <img src="./images/info_tutorial1_en.png">
  <p>Figure 1: Representation of a service system as a flow chart</p>
</div>

<p>
In queueing simulation, service systems are mapped in the form of <strong>flowcharts</strong>.
A service system can be either a simple supermarket queue or a complex production or logistics system.
The elements of the flow diagram correspond to the process stations and other stations within the system.
The connecting arrows between the elements are the possible paths that customers can take through the system.
The customers are represented in the animation as small symbols that move from station to station.
</p>

<p>
All queueing models have to have at least one <strong>source</strong> and one <strong>exit</strong>.
Customers are generated at the source. From this station, they move through the system.
Consequently, a source has no incoming edges (no customers can be led to a source) but exactly one outgoing edge
(via which the newly created customers leave the source and move through the system).
The opposite is true for exits: these can each have one or more incoming edges
(via which the customers arrive at the respective exit).
As the customers finally leave the system at an exit, exits have no outgoing edges,
i.e. a customer who has reached an exit disappears from the model at this station.
</p>

<p>
The actual operation logic takes place between the source and exit.
The main flow chart element for this is the <strong>process station</strong>.
At this station, incoming customers are served by one or more operators
and have to wait in a queue if no free operator is available at the time of their arrival.
</p>

<h3>Elementenvorlagen</h3>

<div class="titledimage">
  <img src="./images/info_tutorial2_en.png">
  <p>Figure 2: Element template panel on the left-hand side of the program window</p>
</div>

<p>
On the left-hand side of the program window, you will find the element templates panel overwritten with
<strong><i class="bi bi-plus-square"></i>&nbsp;Add stations</strong>  for creating the flow diagram (see Figure 2).
If another program function has been selected and the element templates panel therefore is no longer displayed,
you can return to this function at any time using the button with the same name in the toolbar at the top of the program window.
</p>

<p>
Individual stations can be dragged and dropped from the element template panel onto the drawing area.
Stations that are already on the drawing area can be moved using drag&amp;drop.
To delete a station again, click on it and then either press the <span class="key">Del</span> key
or click on the "<i class="bi bi-trash"></i>&nbsp;Delete station" button on the left in the properties panel.
</p>

<h3>Building a simple model</h3>

<div class="titledimage">
  <img src="./images/info_tutorial3_en.png">
  <p>Figure 3: Stations for a first model</p>
</div>

<p>
In the following, a simple M/M/1 model will be constructed. This service system consists of a source at which customers
arrive with exponentially distributed inter-arrival times, and a process station at which an operator works and requires
a random, also exponentially distributed service time per service. Served customers leave the system via a subsequent exit station.
</p>

<p>
To build this model, the following three stations have to be dragged from the template panel onto the drawing area
one after the other and placed in a row from left to right (see also figure 3):
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Source</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Process</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Exit</strong></li>
</ol>

<div class="titledimage">
  <img src="./images/info_tutorial4_en.png">
  <p>Figure 4: Function for adding connecting edges</p>
</div>

<p>
In a second step, the path of the customers through the model have to be defined using connection arrows.
The customers are created at the source, should move from there to the process station and, after successful
service process at this station, be directed to the exit where they leave the model.
</p>

<p>
The following connections are required for this:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Source &rarr; Process</li>
  <li>Process &rarr; Exit</li>
</ul>

<div class="titledimage">
  <img src="./images/info_tutorial5_en.png">
  <p>Figure 5: Complete M/M/1 model</p>
</div>

<p>
To add connecting edges, the <strong><i class="bi bi-share-fill"></i>&nbsp;Add edges</strong> function
in the horizontal toolbar at the top of the program window has to be activated (see figure 4).
To add an edge to the model with the insert function activated, first click on the start and then the target element of the edge,
i.e. first the source and then the process station. Then the process station and then the exit.
This should result in a model as shown in figure 5.
</p>

<h3>Editing the model parameters</h3>

<div class="titledimage">
  <img src="./images/info_tutorial6_en.png">
  <p>Figure 6: Panel for editing the station parameters</p>
</div>

<p>
The default values set at the source and the process station are that a customer arrives at the source every 100 seconds on average
and that a service process at the process station takes 80 seconds on average and one operator works at the station.
This results in a capacity utilization of 80%. Furthermore, coefficients of variation of 1 are set for both the
inter-arrival times and the service times. Specifically, the exponential distribution is used for both times during the simulation.
This results in an analytically calculable M/M/1 model. The simulation should therefore produce the following approximate parameters after a long runtime:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Average queue length: <strong>E[N<sub>Q</sub>]=3.2</strong></li>
  <li>Average number of customers in the system: <strong>E[N]=4</strong></li>
  <li>Average waiting time: <strong>E[W]=320 seconds</strong></li>
  <li>Average residence time: <strong>E[V]=400 seconds</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
As the purpose of a simulation is not to reproduce results that can already be calculated analytically,
it will be important to be able to vary the parameters of the model later on. To change the settings of a station,
it has to be first clicked. The parameters of the station then appear in the sidebar on the left-hand side of the
program window and can also be changed there. In figure 6, the process station has been clicked.
The configurable parameters of the process station are displayed on the left.
</p>

<h3>Running a simulation</h3>

<div class="titledimage">
  <img src="./images/info_tutorial7_en.png">
  <p>Figure 7: Program window during a running animation</p>
</div>

<p>
Once the model has been fully constructed, it can be simulated in order to determine the associated parameters (such as the average waiting time of customers, etc.).
In Mini Warteschlangensimulator, a simulation is always carried out using an animation.
To start an animation, the <strong><i class="bi bi-play-circle"></i>&nbsp;Animation</strong> button has to be clicked.
The model is then checked for logical errors (e.g. missing connecting edges) and if successful, the animation is started.
The program window should then look as shown in figure 7. The drawing area shows how the individual customers move through the system.
The animation sidebar, outlined in red in figure 7, shows the continuously updated system parameters.
The buttons at the top of this sidebar can be used to pause the animation or change the speed.
</p>

<p>
To end a running animation and return to editor mode, simply click the <strong><i class="bi bi-play-circle"></i>&nbsp;Animation</strong> button again.
</p>

<p>
In order to route a large number of customers through the system (without animation output) for statistically stable results,
the <strong><i class="bi bi-chevron-double-right"></i>&nbsp;Simulation</strong> button in the animation sidebar has to be
clicked while the animation function is activated. The current animation is then terminated and instead a total of 5 million
customers are moved through the system without graphical output. The results of this simulation are then displayed.
</p>
